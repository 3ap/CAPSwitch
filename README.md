# CAPSwitch 

This is a tiny and simple utility for Microsoft Windows, written back in 2008.
The sole purpose of this utility was to let us switch keyboard layouts by using
the CapsLock key.

There are neither sophisticated documentation nor UI of any kind. Once started,
it runs quetly in background until you start it again with the "/q" command line
paramater.
